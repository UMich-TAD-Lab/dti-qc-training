# DTI Quality Control Trainging 
## Undergraduate Training Resource for DTI Artifact Identification


## Cardinal Rules of Artifact Checking
1. Each ID must have three independent reporters for artifact identification
1. Artifact identification must be done independently! Do not seek the opinion of other artifact reporters who are assigned the same ID. 

## Required resources: 
fslview
high resolustion moniters (laptops and low resolution monitors are not recommended)
atleast 3 lab members to identify artifacts. Recommend 6 RA's work in teams of 2 in order to identify artifacts
time: RA's will take approximately 1 hour to search for artifacts in a single ID. Budget undergrad workload to account for 3 hours of artifact checking per DTI scan. 


## Documentation: 
Master tracking log *insert excel
    *Permission status: all lab members have read & write access
Artifact Reporter (1,2,3) identified artifacts *insert excel
    *Permission status: read & write access limited to RA(s) assigned to one of the three reporters
    
    
## How to Identify Artifacts
2.	Open Fslview from applications
2.  In fslview select: File -> Open -> DTI RAW DATA PATH
2.  Adjust brightness *insert brightness image
2.  Check for artifacts by beginning at the bottom of the brain and scrolling up until you have checked each slice, bottom to top.
